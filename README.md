Question 1.    (24 points) 
Below are the choices made   by   Albert,   Brittney,   and   Calvin when   choosing   from   diferent   sets   of   fruits.
Menu Albert’s Choices Brittney’s Choices Calvin’s   Choices (1) Apple, Banana Apple Apple, Banana Apple (2) Banana, Pear Pear Banana Banana (3) Apple, Pear Apple Apple Apple (4) Apple, Banana, Pear Pear Banana Apple 
1.    (4    points)      Can   Albert’s   choices   be   represented   by   any   utility   function?       If   so, ﬁnd   a   utility function that represents his choices. If not, explain why   by   ﬁnding   contradictions   in   the   implications   of his   choices.
2.    (4   points)   Do   Albert’s   choices   violate   Axiom   α   or   β?
3.    (4   points)   Can   Brittney’s   choices   be   represented   by   any   utility   function?       If   so,   ﬁnd   a   utility function that represents her choices. If not, explain why by ﬁnding contradictions   in   the   implications   of her   choices.
4.    (4   points)   Do   Brittney’s   choices   violate   Axiom   α   or   β?
5.    (4    points)      Can Calvin’s   choices   be   represented   by   any   utility   function?       If   so, ﬁnd   a   utility function that represents his choices. If not, explain why   by   ﬁnding   contradictions   in   the   implications   of his   choices.

Question 2.    (40 points) 
Three   students,   named   A,   B,   and   C,   have   the   same   reference-dependent   utility   function   over   pens, p,   and   money,   m,
ur   (p,   m) = vp(p -   rp) + vm(m -   rm)
where   rp is   their   pen   reference   point,   rm is   their   money   reference   point.   Their   value   function   for   pens   is   given   by

and   their   value   function   for   money   is   given   by
Suppose that their reference point is the status quo, that is,   their   initial   endowments. Student   A   owns   a   pen   and   is willing to   sell   it   for   a   price   of a dollars   or   more.    Student   B   does   not   own   a   pen   and   is   willing   to   pay   代 写ECON30019 Assignment 1

Student   C   does   not   own   a   pen   and   is   indiferent   between   getting   a   pen   and   getting   c dollars.For   each   of the   following   values   of   λp and   λm,   (i)   solve   for   a,   b,   and   c,   (ii)   provide   a   one-   or two-sentence   interpretation of your results,   and   (iii)   explain whether   the   endowment   efect   will   be   observed   in   this   case.
1.    (10   points)   λp    = λm    =   1.
2.    (10   points)   λp    = 2,   λm    =   1.
3.    (10   points)   λp    =   1,   λm   = 2.
4.    (10   points)   λp    = 3,   λm    = 2.
Question 3.    (36 points) 
Sam’s   preferences   over   cofee   mug, c, and   money, m, can   be   represented   by   the reference-dependent   utility   function
ur   (c,   m) = 4c + v (c -   rc) + 4m + v (m -   rm)
where   rc is his   cofee   mug   reference   point, rm is his   money   reference   point, and   the   value   function   v (·)   is   deﬁned   as

Suppose   that   his   reference   point   is   the   status   quo,   that   is,   his   initial   endowments.
1.    (13   points)   What   is   the   maximum   price   Sam   would   be   willing   to   pay   to   buy   a   cofee   mug?      What   is   the   minimum   price   Sam   would   be   willing   to   accept   to   sell   a   cofee   mug   he   already   owned?
2.    (13    points)    Suppose now that Sam’s utility function is not reference-dependent but   varies   with   ownership.   When   he   does   not   currently   own   a   mug,   his   utility   function   is
unonowner (c,   m)   = 5c + 7m 
When   he   owns   a   mug,   his   utility   function   is 
uowner (c,   m)   =   7c + 5mWhat   is   the   maximum   price   Sam   would   be   willing   to   pay   to   buy   a   cofee   mug?    What   is   the   minimum   price   Sam   would   be   willing   to   accept   to   sell   a   cofee   mug   he   already   owned?
3.    (10   points)   Do   your   answers   to   previous   questions   suggest   that   loss   aversion   and   own-   ership   attachment   can   both   explain   the   endowment   efect?
